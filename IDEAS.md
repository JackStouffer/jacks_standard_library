# Ideas

Nice to haves or ideas for enhancement

* Cleaner template solution
    * printf strings get us off the ground but they're hack-y
    * Other "template" / "preprocessor" languages have to already exist
    with defined grammars
    * Maybe we can just use one of those
    * Have the templates be in a separate file for easier editing
